The goal of the First Words project is a journal for parents and is an interactive guide through
their childâ€™s first words. First Words lets parents record when each new word is learned by their
child. Pictures and the definition (parents can use their own custom definition) are pulled from
google image search (using the strictest settings) and dictionary.com respectively; allowing the
parents to walk through the images with their child to learn about the word and its use in
different contexts.
