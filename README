The goal of the Baby's First Words project is a journal for parents and is an interactive guide through their child’s first words. Baby's First Words lets parents record when each new word is learned by their child. Pictures and the definition (parents can use their own custom definition) are pulled from google image search (using the strictest settings) and dictionary.com respectively; allowing the
parents to walk through the images with their child to learn about the word and its use in different contexts.
